### bigInt 的内部实现

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54297544/v8-bigint-size-in-memory

#### 原文

V8 developer here. There is generally no way to determine the occupied memory size of an object, and BigInts are no exception. Why do you want to access it?

As far as the internal implementation in V8 is concerned, a BigInt has a small object header (currently two pointer sizes; this might change over time), and then a bit for every bit of the BigInt, rounded up to multiples of a pointer size. 99999 is a 17-bit number, so in your example let a = 99999n ("BigInt(99999n)" is superfluous!), the allocated BigInt will consume (2 + Math.ceil(17/64)) * 64 bits === 24 bytes on a 64-bit system.

It may or may not make sense to add length-related properties or methods (.bitLength?) to BigInts in the future. If you have a use case, I suggest you file an issue at https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint/issues so that it can be discussed.

#### 翻译

一个bigInt类型的数据在内存里有一个小的对象标头（当前是两个指针的大小，之后可能会改变），之后每一位占用一个bit，按照指针的大小来进行向上取整。例如99999是一个占用17bit的数，所以99999n占用的内存大小为(2+Math.ceil(17/64))*64 bits = 24bytes 所以99999n在64位系统上占据24个字节。
